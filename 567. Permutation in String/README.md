## Question
Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, return `true` if `s2` contains a permutation of `s1`, or `false` otherwise.

In other words, return `true` if one of `s1`'s permutations is the substring of `s2`.

## Solution
```typescript
function checkInclusion(s1: string, s2: string): boolean {
    const windowSize = s1.length;
    const charIndex = (c: string) => {
        return c.charCodeAt(0) - 97;
    }

    const isPermutation = (s1: string, s2: string) => {
        if (s1.length !== s2.length) return false;
        const count = new Array(26).fill(0);
        for (let i = 0; i < s1.length; i++){
            count[charIndex(s1[i])]++
            count[charIndex(s2[i])]--
        }
        for (let i = 0; i < count.length; i++){
            if (count[i] !== 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < s2.length; i++){
        const substr = s2.slice(i, i + windowSize);
        if (substr.length === s1.length){
            if (isPermutation(substr, s1)) return true;
        }
    }

    return false
};
```
## Explanation
- First, we define a function to check if two strings are permutations of eachother.
    * As we know the characters are lowercase english alphabet, we initialize an array of zeroes of size 26
    * Next, we iterate over each character of both strings simultaneously as we have already checked if they are the same size
    * For the first string, we increment the corresponding value at the index of the character
    * For the second, we decrement the corresponding value at the index of the character
        + e.g. if `s1[i] === "a"`, we increment `count[1]`, if `s2[i] === "a"`, we decrement `count[1]`
    * If the count array is all zeroes at the end, this is a permutation
- Next, we create a sliding window of the size of `s1`
- Slide the window and slice `s2` from the current index to the size of the window and check for permutations

## Complexity
**Runtime**: O(n * m) <br/>
> where n is the length of s2 and m is the length of s1. We iterate over the size of s1 in the permutation function as well as over the count array which is constant size of 26 (does not count in runtime calculation). 

**Space**: O(1)
