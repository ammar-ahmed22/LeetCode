## Question
Given a string `s` containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
 - Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
- Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

## Solution
```typescript
function isValid(s: string): boolean {
    const dict = {
        "{": "}",
        "[": "]",
        "(": ")"
    }
    const stack = [];
    const opening = ["(", "{", "["]
    for (let c of s){
        if (opening.includes(c)){
            stack.push(c)
        } else {
            const top = stack.pop()
            if (c !== dict[top]) return false
        }
    }
    return stack.length === 0
};
```

## Explanation
- Initialize a stack and dictionary mapping open brackets to closed brackets
- Iterate over the characters in the string
- If the character is an opening bracket push to the stack
- If it is a closing bracket
  + Take the top off of the stack
  + Compare the character to the last element in the stack (top, opening bracket)
    * If it maps to the correct bracket, continue
    * Otherwise, return early (`false`)
- After iterating, if the stack is empty, it is valid
