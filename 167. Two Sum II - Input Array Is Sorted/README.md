## Question
Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is already **sorted in non-decreasing order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return the indices of the two numbers, `index1` and `index2`, added by one as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**. You **may not** use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

## Solution
```typescript
function twoSum(numbers: number[], target: number): number[] {
    let l: number = 0, 
        r: number = numbers.length - 1;
    while(true){
        const sum = numbers[l] + numbers[r];
        if (sum < target){
            l++
        } else if (sum > target){
            r--
        } else {
            return [l + 1, r + 1]
        }
    }
};
```
## Explanation
- Sliding pointers approach
- Start with pointers on each end
  * Calculate sum
    + If sum is less than target, we want to increase the sum, move left pointer (bigger number)
    + If sum is greater than target, we want to decrease the sum, move right pointer (smaller number)
  * Return when found 

## Complexity
**Runtime**: O(n)<br/>
**Space**: O(1)
