## Question
You are given an array prices where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.
## Solution
```typescript
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
    let buy: number, sell: number = 0;
    let maxProfit: number = 0;

    while(sell < prices.length){
        const profit = prices[sell] - prices[buy];
        if (profit > 0){
            maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, profit);
        } else {
            buy = sell
        }
        sell++
    }

    return maxProfit
};
```
## Explanation
- Initialize two pointers for the buy and sell points as well as variable to store the max profit
- Iterate while sell pointer is less than the prices array length
- Calculate the profit on each iteration
  * If profit is greater than 0
    + Update max profit
  * Otherwise, buy pointer moves to the last sell pointer
    + buy pointer only moves if profit is negative or zero 
- Sell pointer incremented on every iteration

**Runtime**: O(n)<br/>
**Space**: O(1)
