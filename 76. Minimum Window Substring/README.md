## Question
Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return the **minimum window substring** of `s` such that every character in `t` ***(including duplicates)*** is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string `""`.

***The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.***

## Solution
```typescript
function minWindow(s: string, t: string): string {
    if (t === "") return "";
    const count : Record<string, number> = {};
    const window: Record<string, number> = {};

    for (let c of t){
        count[c] = 1 + (count[c] ?? 0)
    }
    

    let curr = 0;
    let req = Object.keys(count).length;
    let l = 0;
    let result = "";
    let resLength = Infinity;
    for (let r = 0; r < s.length; r++){
        const c = s[r];
        window[c] = 1 + (window[c] ?? 0);
        if (c in count && window[c] === count[c]){
            curr++
        }

        while(curr === req){
            const windowLen = r - l + 1;
            if (windowLen < resLength){
                resLength = windowLen;
                result = s.slice(l, r + 1);
            }
            window[s[l]]--
            if (s[l] in count && window[s[l]] < count[s[l]]){
                curr--
            }
            l++
        }
    }

    return result;
};
```

## Explanation
- First, we create a hashmap counting all the characters in the string `t`
- Next, we have two variables, `curr` and `req`.
  * `curr` tracks the number of conditions currently met
  * `req` is the number of conditions needed to be met to be a valid subtring
    + A valid substring will have the exact count of characters in `t`
    + e.g. if `t = "AABC"`, a valid substring will need to meet `3` conditions
      * 2 "A", 1 "B" and 1 "C"
- We create variables to track the result and the current result length
- Variable for the left pointer
- Iterate the string `s`
  * On each iteration, we update a hashmap for the window with the count of the characters
  * If a condition is met on that iterating, we update `curr`
  * If `curr` and `req` are equal, we have found a valid substring
    + The substring goes from `l` to `r`
    + If the current substring is smaller than the result
      * Update result
    + Remove the leftmost element from the window and check the conditions again
    + Decrease the size of the window and continue iterating
